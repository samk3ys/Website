              <p>I started building this website in June 2019.
                 The reason for it is to record my projects online.
                 It should serve as a good tool to market myself to find a job as well.
                 After all I'm going into my senior year at college.
                 I've been fabricating a lot of logos and such for the site like the one above.</p>

              <h2>IEEE WORKBENCH</h2>
              <h5>August 2019</h5>

              <img src="images/Project - workbench.jpg" style="width:35%;"/>
              <p>During my junior year I became heavily involved with UK IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers), especially the robotics team.
                 The big problem throughout the year is we had no easy way to transport and store our tools and materials.
                 So I designed a custom workbench that would fit our needs and be very flexible for any future needs.
                 It has 3 drawers, a lot of pegboard space, a vice, castors for mobility, and it's modular!
                 It comes apart so we can take it to robotics competitions if we want to.
                 Then I spent most of August 2019 building the actual thing.
                 I still need to do a few small things to it, but it is now at UK and being used!</p>

              <p>This is a novelty cartridge holder for my Nintendo Switch games.
                 I designed it myself using Autodesk 123D.
                 Some springs are included in the design to make the push button functional: it pops the lid open!
                 I published the files on my <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/samk3ys/designs">Thingiverse page</a> if you'd like to print one yourself.</p>

              <p>A project for my embedded systems course (CPE 287) of sophomore year.
                 I worked with a friend, Devon Schleyer, to make a snake game running on a TI Launchpad microcontroller.
                 It's got a 8x8 bi-color LED matrix, a controller, and a cool laser-cut wooden enclosure.

              <h2>EAGLE PROJECT</h2>
              <h5>June 15, 2013</h5>
              <img src="images/Project - Eagle.jpg" style="width:50%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;"/>
              <p>Each Scout must lead a service project as their final milestone on the path to the highest rank of Eagle Scout. 
                 My project's goal was to replace a rotting picnic table with a more durable table along with benches surrounding a track and soccer field.
                 Before starting the project I had to fill out a mountain of paperwork, get approval from the surrounding neighborhood, raise funds, and flesh out my plan.
                 Thanks to some generous donations I was able to get the table, 3 benches, plaques commemorating those donors (from <a href="https://www.eaglesign.com/">Eagle Sign & Design</a>), plus trees and shrubs. 
                 To help the actual work go smoothly I designed teams with specific tasks laid out on some graphical flyers. 
                 My wonderful friends of <a href="https://middletown71.mytroop.us/">Troop 71</a> divided into those teams and helped bring my project to fruition. 
                 The result was better than I hoped and everything is still being enjoyed.
              </p>
              <p>This was my first big project. I worked very hard to ensure it went swimmingly. I accomplished something I believe was important and useful, while learning a lot along the way.
                 My brother completed his Eagle Project during the same year and we both achieved the rank of Eagle Scouts; we the two youngest Eagles our troop had seen yet. We remained active in our troop and ended with 6 palms (additional degrees to the rank of Eagle Scout) each. 
                 Scouting taught me countless valuable lessons, brought me many friends, and took me on wilderness adventures. 
                 For everything the BSA did I am grateful and I would not be the man I am today without it's institution.
